<p>Welcome to the maintain elastic tool. The goal for this tool is to help people maintain their elasticsearch cluster.
At the moment their are two big parts in the tool. One to maintain everthing related to indexes and another one to
    backup and restore your indexes using the snapshot/restore functionality.</p>
